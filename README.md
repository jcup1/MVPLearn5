# MVPLearn5
I created this project to learn:
-MVP pattern
-Repository pattern
-Testing using Mockito
-RxJava2
-Dagger injection

Later I will implement everything I learned in MyWins2 that's also shared on my github.

Things already learned:

-basic MVP on my own
-simple MVP test with and without Mockito(only junit)
-static imports
-shortcuts(ctrl+alt+(v||f||c), .var)
